Goal is to learn the fundamentals of data fetching with React

Things I learned ->

1. Understand passing props on a better level
2. Grasping the 'waterfall' way React is, like making sure things are passed to the correct components so the app works the way it's expected!
3. Really enjoying the API practice we are getting!
4. Even though it is more files than what I was used to, ultimately I believe once I get even more understanding of React, coding will be a lot easier than with vanilla JavaScript!
